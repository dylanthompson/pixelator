# pixelator
Pixel art utility

Creates Gif animated gradients and hopefully other animated elements

**A) Installation and Building Pixelator Library**
1) Requires Node and npm
 - https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

2) Needs Typescript
> npm install -g typescript

3) Install and Package
> npm run install-and-package

This will produce an npm package .\dist\pixelator-0.0.1.tgz

**B) Test Application**
The test app will consume the library as an NPM package and has a different build.  
For debugging purposes you can just add experiments to pixelator, but use this app to simulate consumption ofthe library as a package.
See test/
Make sure you ran the steps from section A) before doing these steps
0) Go to test app directory
> cd test

1) Install and Build test
run this any time pixelator is rebuilt
> npm run clean-install-and-build

1.a) Build App Only
Run if only test app changed, but pixelator has not changed
> tsc -d

2) Run test app
> node .\test.js

Change gifs.json define a bunch of different kinds of gifs.  the queue defines what will be generated by pixelator.  Themes.json is just lists of colors used to make gradients.

Also modify test.ts, use gifGenerator or write your own script
